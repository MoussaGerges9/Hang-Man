#Hangman game
Hangman game using C++ console. If you don't know the game, you should guess the word by entering certain number of letters before hanging the man. I added more features like:
- Different levels.
- Anti cheating when you enter more than two letters.
- One help to guess only the first letter of the word.

Finally my word list is italian words so obviously you can change the list to your preferred language and i commented some numbers as indicators to help you to change the code depending on your list. (For english edition check: https://github.com/MoussaGerges9/Hangman-Game)
